Viewer for dxf:
sudo apt-get install freecad librecad
freecad and librecad didn't open BE1275_.DXF seems its corrupted

Python libraries:
sudo pip install dxfgrabber
sudo pip install dxfwrite

http://dxfgrabber.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

In the file Be1.dxf the figure is defined by LINE(s) (which are initial and ending points defined) like:
(355.718804, 305.992988, 0.0) - (390.392461, 407.16292, 0.0)
