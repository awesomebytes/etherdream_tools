Viewer for dxf:
sudo apt-get install freecad librecad
freecad and librecad didn't open BE1275_.DXF seems its corrupted

Python libraries:
sudo pip install dxfgrabber
sudo pip install dxfwrite



DXF file is weirdly organized:
http://dxfgrabber.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

In the file Be1.dxf the figure is defined by LINE(s) (which are initial and ending points defined) like:
(355.718804, 305.992988, 0.0) - (390.392461, 407.16292, 0.0)


But also ARC(s) are defined... which have the properties:
arct.center        arct.extrusion     arct.ltscale       arct.startangle
arct.color         arct.invisible     arct.paperspace    arct.thickness
arct.dxftype       arct.layer         arct.radius        arct.transparency
arct.endangle      arct.linetype      arct.shadow_mode   arct.true_color

So... there is a center  (154.162281, 375.071832, 0.0) and initial and final angle defining it... and a radius
